# ðŸ§  PixelHeal: Autoregressive Image Inpainting using PixelRNN

## 1. Introduction
This assignment focused on building a deep learning model for **image inpainting** â€” the process of reconstructing missing or occluded parts of an image. The goal was to develop a system that can intelligently fill in these missing regions, restoring realistic and coherent visuals.  
To achieve this, we implemented a simplified **PixelRNN**, an autoregressive neural network that predicts each pixel based on the previously generated ones. The project was divided into multiple phases covering dataset preparation, model implementation, training, evaluation, and visualization through a Streamlit app.

## 2. Methodology

### Dataset
We used a paired image dataset consisting of two aligned folders:
- `data/train/occluded/` â€” images with artificially applied occlusions.
- `data/train/original/` â€” their corresponding original (unmasked) images.

Each sample pair shared the same filename to ensure direct mapping between occluded and ground truth versions. Images were resized to 64Ã—64 pixels and normalized to the [0,1] range.

### Preprocessing
- Resized all images to a uniform size (64Ã—64).
- Converted images to tensors.
- Batched data for efficient GPU/CPU training using PyTorchâ€™s `DataLoader`.

### Model Architecture
The **PixelRNN** model was implemented using **masked convolutional layers** to maintain the autoregressive property â€” ensuring that predictions for a pixel depend only on previous pixels.

**Key layers:**
- MaskedConv2d-A: Prevents the model from using future pixel information.
- MaskedConv2d-B: Allows learning from the current and past pixels.
- ReLU activations for non-linearity.
- Final convolutional layer for reconstructing RGB values.

The architecture progressively learns to predict pixel distributions conditioned on visible context.

## 3. Results

### Training Process
The model was trained for **20 epochs** with the following parameters:
- Optimizer: Adam (`lr = 1e-3`)
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Batch Size: 8

The **training loss** steadily decreased, indicating that the model effectively learned to minimize reconstruction errors between occluded and original images.

### Sample Reconstructions
Every few epochs, reconstructed samples were saved to visually assess improvement.

| Occluded | Predicted (Reconstructed) | Original |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------|
| ![Occluded](../outputs/figures/epoch_2_samples.png) | ![Predicted](../outputs/figures/epoch_8_samples.png) | ![Original](../outputs/figures/epoch_10_samples.png) |

*(Images represent progressive refinement as training advanced.)*

## 4. Discussion
The model showed a clear progression in generating smoother and more coherent image reconstructions over time. Early epochs produced blurry outputs, while later ones restored finer details and color consistency.

**Observations:**
- The autoregressive design allowed the network to learn strong spatial dependencies.
- Some reconstructions still displayed minor color mismatches or artifacts in complex regions.
- Training on CPU was slow; using GPU acceleration significantly improved convergence speed.
- Image alignment between occluded and original pairs was crucial â€” missing or mismatched files caused `FileNotFoundError` issues that were later resolved.

Overall, PixelHeal demonstrated the potential of autoregressive models in image completion tasks.

## 5. Conclusion
This project successfully implemented and trained a **PixelRNN-based image inpainting model** capable of restoring missing parts of occluded images. The results validate the modelâ€™s ability to learn contextual pixel dependencies and progressively generate more coherent images.  
Future improvements could include:
- Scaling to higher resolutions.
- Introducing attention mechanisms.
- Using GAN-based refinements for sharper restorations.

PixelHeal represents an important step toward intelligent visual recovery systems.
